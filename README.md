# portswigger-academy-methodology

This repository showcases my approaches to various PortSwigger Web Security Academy Labs. Rather than serving as detailed walkthroughs, these notes offer a concise overview of my methodology in identifying exploits within web applications. While not exhaustive, it serves as a practical benchmark for my proficiency in discovering web-app security vulnerabilities.

The order that labs appear in this repository is based on the order they appear in the "All Labs" section of PortSwigger Academy. This is different from the order that they appear in "All Topics," and includes labs that do not appear in topic modules.
